# shambhavi-v1
Python Scripts with automated timers for Shambhavi

## Instructions

1. I highly recommend downloading the 2 files to your local directly instead of cloning or forking
2. If you prefer to fork/clone, I recommend forking
3. I do not recommend cloning, but if you do end up cloning the repo, please do not stage/commit any of the changes you make in your local to the remote
